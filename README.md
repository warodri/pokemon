This is the README file for my test application
getting Pokemon information from REST API [Pokéapi](http://pokeapi.co/).

If you use Eclipse: Got to "File" menu, then Import and finally select from "General" Existing Projects into Workspace

Possible Test Cases 
===================
I'd do test cases for all the methods getting JSON data from this API, to make sure we have a result from server on a correct URL.

I'd also test the JSON parsing methods (using a dummy JSON response) to make sure our parser works correctly and is available to parse responses.
